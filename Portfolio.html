        <h1>A Journey of Perseverance and Resilience</h1>
        <h2>Early Life and Family Struggles</h2>
        
        Chinna Munnelli was born in 1999 in Kondugaripalli, a small village in Kadapa. Growing up in a poor family, life was anything but easy. His father, struggled immensely to provide for the family, often working long hours just to put food on the table. Despite the hardships, Subbaiah and his wife, Bhagyamma, instilled strong values and a relentless work ethic in their children.
        
        Chinna, the youngest of five brothers and one sister, witnessed firsthand the sacrifices his parents made. The sight of his father coming home exhausted from work left a lasting impression on him, driving his determination to succeed.
        
       <h2>Education: The Pursuit of Knowledge Amidst Adversity</h2> 
        
        Chinna attended government schools in Kadapa, where he demonstrated an early love for learning. His academic journey continued at a local college where he pursued a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. Despite the lack of quality faculty and the challenges posed by an uncooperative academic environment, Chinna Subbaiah remained focused. He was studious and disciplined, often standing up against the injustice he faced from certain faculty members who had misled him during the admission process. This experience toughened him, but it was also during the difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic that he completed his graduation, emerging with distinction.
        
        After graduating, Chinna moved to Hyderabad in November 2020, driven by a passion for mechanical design. However, financial constraints meant he couldn’t afford a laptop, forcing him to practice on desktop computers at public facilities. Despite these limitations, he completed the course but found his job prospects limited. His attempts to secure part-time work in hotels and call centers were met with rejection, adding to his frustration.
        
       <h2>Battling Depression and Seeking New Beginnings</h2> 
        
        As job rejections mounted, depression began to take a toll on Chinna's health. Determined not to give up, he left Hyderabad and moved to Bangalore, enrolling in Jspiders in February 2022, a renowned institute for Java Full Stack development. Even before joining, he desperately searched for part-time jobs in far-off areas like Hebbal, but faced rejection once again.
        
        The Jspiders institute boasted of ties with over 2100 companies, fueling Chinna's hope that he would soon secure a job. However, he quickly realized that there were limited opportunities for those with a mechanical background. Despite the challenges, he remained optimistic. It was during this time that a friend's suggestion led him to apply for a position at TCS, where he was surprisingly selected.
        
        <h2>The TCS Chapter: Trials and Triumphs</h2>
        
        Joining TCS marked a significant turning point in Chinna’s life. However, it wasn’t without its challenges. He faced criticism from both his peers and even the co-founder of Jspiders, who belittled his decision to join TCS due to the lower salary. Despite the ridicule, Chinna Subbaiah remained focused, understanding that this was a stepping stone towards his larger goals.
        
        For a year, he was on the bench at TCS, a period of waiting that tested his patience. Eventually, he was assigned to a support project, where he gained valuable experience. After proving his capabilities, he requested a transfer to a development project, where he learned essential development concepts. Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications, he was released from the project prematurely. This setback didn’t deter him; instead, he fought for an allocation that aligned with his aspirations and eventually succeeded.
        
        <h2>Looking Forward: A Future Fueled by Determination</h2>
        
        Chinna’s journey is a testament to resilience, determination, and the unyielding human spirit. From his humble beginnings in Kondugaripalli to overcoming the numerous challenges in his educational and professional life, he has proven time and again that setbacks are merely setups for comebacks.
        
        Now, as he continues to grow in his career, Chinna looks forward to new challenges, confident in his ability to overcome them. His story serves as an inspiration to all who face adversity, reminding them that with perseverance, anything is possible.</p>

        <h1>Professional Project Experience</h1>
    </div>
        Throughout my professional career, I have had the opportunity to work on three significant projects, each contributing to my growth and expertise in the ServiceNow platform:
        <br><br><div class="project1">
            <a href="https://www.biogen.com/">
        <img id="bio" src="https://bioconnectiowa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BioConnect-Iowa-Logo-Color-1.png" alt="" height="230" width="600"></a>
           <p> <b>1. BIOGENConnect </b>
            Focus Areas: ITSM, HRSD, ITOM, GRC
            
            The BIOGENConnect project was a comprehensive initiative that involved the integration and implementation of multiple ServiceNow modules, including IT Service Management (ITSM), Human Resources Service Delivery (HRSD), IT Operations Management (ITOM), and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). My role in this project allowed me to gain a deep understanding of how these modules interact and support the overall business processes within an organization. I was responsible for configuring, customizing, and ensuring the seamless operation of these modules, which are critical for the effective management of IT services, HR processes, operational efficiency, and compliance.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project2">
            <p><b>2. OUTOKUMPU</b>
                Focus Area: ITSM Development (All Submodules)
                
                In the OUTOKUMPU project, my primary focus was on the development and enhancement of all submodules within the IT Service Management (ITSM) suite. This project required extensive hands-on work with various ITSM submodules, where I was involved in the development of features, customization of workflows, and optimization of processes to meet the specific needs of the client. My contributions helped improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the IT service delivery, ensuring that the system was tailored to support the organization’s unique operational requirements.

           <p><b> 3. TransAlta</b>
            Focus Areas: CMDB, Discovery
            
            The TransAlta project was centered around Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and Discovery. My role in this project involved working extensively on the CMDB to ensure that it accurately reflected the organization's IT infrastructure, including the relationships and dependencies between different components. Additionally, I worked with ServiceNow's Discovery tool to automate the identification and documentation of assets within the IT environment. This project was crucial in enhancing the visibility and control over the organization's IT assets, enabling better decision-making and operational management.</h3>
